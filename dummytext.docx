# Python Code Documentation

## Introduction
This code is designed to facilitate data manipulation and analysis using Pandas, a powerful library in Python, primarily focused on numerical tables and time series. The script requires three essential inputs: the PPS template of a particular project, a flat file containing previous data in a unified format, and the specific row for entering the existing PPS flat file data.

## Installation
Ensure that the Pandas library and VS Code editor are installed via the software center before executing this code.

## Functionality Overview
The code can be segregated into two primary segments. The first segment deals with sheet values, including project definitions, cost, and schedule headings. The second segment handles the actual data input from the PPS templates.

### Project Definition, Cost, and Schedule Sheet Headings
1. **Loading Workbook Instance:** The code initializes the workbook instance and navigates through a range of cells in the specified sheet.
2. **Array Initialization:** An array is initialized, and a for loop iteration is employed to traverse each cell range, appending the respective cell heading values to this array.
3. **Debugging Checks:** To ensure accuracy, the code incorporates print statements and length checks for the arrays.
4. **Repeat Strategy for Data Values:** A similar approach is adopted for the actual data values against each project heading, involving workbook loading, sheet navigation, cell range traversal, and array initialization and appending.
5. **Saving Data:** Finally, the script writes both the heading array and the value array to a designated flat file sheet. This can either create a new sheet or update/append values to an existing flat file sheet containing a variable number of projects.

## Code Architecture
### Segment 1: Project Definition, Cost, and Schedule Sheet Headings
1. **Workbook Loading:** Initializes the workbook instance.
2. **Cell Range Traversal:** Navigates through specific sheet ranges for headings.
3. **Array Initialization and Population:** Initializes arrays and appends heading values iteratively.
4. **Debugging and Verification:** Incorporates debugging checks and prints the length of arrays for validation.

### Segment 2: Project Data Values
1. **Workbook Loading:** Loads the workbook instance.
2. **Sheet Navigation:** Moves to the specified sheet.
3. **Cell Range Traversal:** Iterates through cell ranges for actual data against each project heading.
4. **Array Initialization and Population:** Initializes arrays and appends actual data values iteratively.
5. **Data Saving:** Writes both heading and value arrays to a flat file sheet.

## Conclusion
This code segmentates the processing of PPS templates into organized segments, ensuring clear separation between heading definitions and actual data values. It implements a systematic approach for data extraction and writing, enabling efficient data management within the specified flat file structure.
